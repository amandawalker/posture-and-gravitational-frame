##Codebook for Raw Data GFR

####Here is the data collected from the gravitational frame of reference experiment on you tube [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-Vqo_O--o).  Participants received extra credit in exchange for their participation. Each entry was transferred by hand, based on email responses.  The data includes three variables:

* Condition: Each participant was in one of two groups, condition A or condition B. The condition was dictated by the month the participant was born in. Participants clicked on the link based on their birth month and emailed the results of their birth month and which side (the results). 
* Month: This is the month each participant was born in.
* Side: This variable represents which player passed the ball (the player on the left or right side).
