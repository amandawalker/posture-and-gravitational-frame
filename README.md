#Experiment on Gravitational Frame of Reference

###Krista Strother & Partner

##Introduction

This repository contains an empirical study on the effect of body posture on a visualization task.

The data, analyses, images, and presentations all represent a reproducible real world example. The data come from my [YouTube experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-Vqo_O--o). Data gathered via email from parcipants were processed and analyzed in R. Results of these analyses can be found in analysis.Rmd and the pptx file in the presentation folder.
